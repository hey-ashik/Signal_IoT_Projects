# Signal - IoT Cloud Control Platform

![Signal IoT Platform](https://esp.ashikone.com/IMGFolder/HomePage.png)

**Signal** is a sophisticated, all-in-one IoT cloud platform designed specifically for ESP32 and ESP8266 devices. It enables users to control hardware from anywhere in the world without the need for complex port forwarding, static IPs, or external VPNs. With a focus on user experience and AI-driven development, Signal makes IoT accessible to both hobbyists and professionals.

## 🛠️ Self-Hosting Setup

To deploy Signal on your own server (e.g., cPanel, VPS, or local XAMPP), follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL/MariaDB database
- SSL certificate (Highly recommended for Web Serial API)

### 2. Configuration
1. Clone the repository to your web server:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Signal_IoT_Projects.git
   ```
2. Open `config.php` and update the database credentials:
   ```php
   define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
   define('DB_NAME', 'your_database_name');
   define('DB_USER', 'your_database_user');
   define('DB_PASS', 'your_database_password');
   define('SITE_URL', 'https://your-domain.com');
   ```

### 3. Database Initialization
1. Navigate to `https://your-domain.com/setup.php` in your browser.
2. This will automatically execute the **Intelligent Installer**. It safely creates all 8 necessary tables (`users`, `projects`, `devices`, `device_logs`, `esp_heartbeat`, `firmware_updates`, etc.). 
   * **Note on Updating**: If you are upgrading from an older version, `setup.php` will automatically detect legacy tables and gracefully patch in new schema capabilities (like Regulator ENUMs and Auto-Timer columns) without *any* data loss!
3. **IMPORTANT**: Delete `setup.php` from your server immediately after completion.

## 📖 How to Get Started

### Step 1: Create an Account
Visit the registration page and create your Signal account. Once logged in, you'll receive a unique **User API Key** which defines your account's cloud access.

### Step 2: Create a New Project
In the dashboard, click on **"New Project"**. Provide a name (e.g., "Smart Home") and a unique folder slug. Signal will generate a **32-character Device Token** specifically for this project.

### Step 3: Get the Code
Signal simplifies the hardware side by offering universal code generation:
- **Standard Code**: Generates standard WiFi and MQTT/HTTP polling logic.
- **Signal Air OTA Code**: Generates advanced code equipped with Over-The-Air update capabilities and the Signal Inject feature, letting you securely change the ESP's WiFi without re-flashing.
- **AI Code Generation**: Use the **AI Code Editor** to describe your project (e.g., *"Make a 4-channel relay controller with a DHT11 sensor"*). The AI will generate the full Arduino source code for you.

### Step 4: Flash Your Device
You have two options to get the code onto your ESP:
1. **Arduino IDE**: Copy the generated code, paste it into Arduino IDE, and upload via USB.
2. **Web Upload**: Go to the **"Upload Code"** section on the Signal dashboard. Select your COM port and flash the firmware directly from your browser using the Web Serial API.

## 🧠 AI Code Editor & Web Flashing

### AI-Powered Intelligence
The **AI Code Editor** is integrated directly into the platform. It understands the Signal API structure and can generate production-ready code for:
- Relay control & Home Automation
- Sensor monitoring (Temperature, Humidity, Ultrasonic, etc.)
- Custom logic based on your hardware attachments.

### No-Install Flashing
Our **Web Serial Terminal** allows you to communicate with your ESP device directly from Chrome or Edge. You can monitor serial logs and upload pre-compiled binaries or scripts without installing any local drivers or software.

## 📱 Mobile App
Take your IoT project everywhere. Download the **Signal Android App** (`SignalApp.apk`) directly from the dashboard to handle projects and toggle pins with a mobile-optimized interface.

---

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), Chart.js (DataPulse), Inter Font, FontAwesome, CSS3 (Glassmorphism).
- **Backend**: PHP 7.4+, PDO (PHP Data Objects).
- **Real-time**: Ajax Poll (Dashboard Auto-Refresh) & Web Serial API.
- **Database**: MySQL / MariaDB (Intelligent Schema Auto-Patching).
